## Summary  |  Honolulu Vacation

Time to treat myself to a vacation, but first, what's the whether like? To help plan my trip to Honolulu, Hawaii. I have decided to do a climate analysis of the area. Part 1 of the analysis I will be using SQLAlchemy ORM queries to extract the data. The data will then be displayed using Matplotlib through a Pandas dataframe. Part 2 consists of a Flask API application that will provide the data in a JSON list.
